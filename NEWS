========================

        Released January 15, 2012

        What's New
        ----------
        * BROWN PAPER BAG RELEASE.  GVA 0.8.1 has a bug that may cause

          terminated.  This release fixes the bug.

GNOME Video Arcade 0.8.1
========================

        Released January 15, 2012

        What's New
        ----------
        * Jordi Mallach moved GVA's stale old home page on GitHub
          to http://live.gnome.org/GnomeVideoArcade.  GNOME Video
          Arcade is now fully hosted on gnome.org!  Thanks Jordi!
        * MAME 0.144 changed its -listxml DTD in a way that breaks
          GNOME Video Arcade, so this release is mainly to adapt to
          the new DTD.  (Thanks again to Jordi Mallach for alerting
          me to the problem.)
        * Fixed some unsightly spacing glitches in the UI caused by
          widget packing changes in GTK v3 versus v2.

        Bugs Fixed

        GNOME #667318: Make GPL blurb translatable

        Other Contributions
        -------------------
        * Edd Barrett reported an assertion tripping on OpenBSD which
          wound up being caused by MAME crashing on OpenBSD, but some
          portability improvements still got committed to GVA in the
          course of the investigation.

GNOME Video Arcade 0.7.1
========================

        Released May 31, 2010

        What's New
        ----------
        * GNOME Video Arcade now detects changes to your ROMs directory,
          such as adding or removing games, while its running and offers
          to rescan your ROM files in order to present an updated game
          list without having to restart the application.
        * GNOME Video Arcade is now a "single-instance" application.
          That means if you launch it while it's already running, it
          will simply present the existing window instead of creating
          a second window.  This adds a new dependency on libunique.

        * If GNOME Video Arcade is built against GTK+ 2.14 or later it will
