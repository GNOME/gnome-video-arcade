Predicate Constraint Language (PCL)
===================================

XXX  These are just random developer notes.  I'll put some nice verbage about
     the language and why it's so special here someday.  -mfb

Python Frame "f_localsplus" Layout

[              fastlocals              ][       freevars       ][ valuestack ]
[ args* ][ varargs ][ kwdict ][ locals ][ cellvars ][ freevars ]

* default values are applied to any NULL args
  in the range [0, co_argcount).

co_argcount = | args |
f_nlocals   = | fastlocals |
f_ncells    = | cellvars |
f_nfreevars = | freevars |  (in the second line)


PCL Short-Term Goals
--------------------

        Static globals
        User-defined classes
        Use glong for hash values (?)
        Cleanup sequence interface (?)
        Redesign operator architecture
        Always pass PclObject as self, even in subclasses
        Advanced table queries (using dynamic execution?)
        Bug: Check for NULL object before calling PCL_xxx_GET_INTERFACE().
        Add members to PclFrame, PclFunction, PclGenerator, PclType
