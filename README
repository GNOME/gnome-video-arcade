GNOME Video Arcade
==================

Written by Matthew Barnes <mbarnes@redhat.com>

GNOME Video Arcade is a clean and simple MAME front-end for the
GNOME Desktop Environment.

This project is targeted towards non-technical arcade enthusiasts
who just want to easily play classic arcade games on their desktop.
Though it may be suitable for use in custom arcade cabinets, the
project is not designed for that purpose.


Dependencies
------------

GNOME Video Arcade has a few external dependencies which need to be
installed prior to compiling the source code:

   - sdlmame or xmame

       These may be available as pre-compiled packages from your
       GNU/Linux distribution.  If not, you can download and compile
       the source code yourself.

          sdlmame:  http://rbelmont.mameworld.info/?page_id=163
          xmame:    http://x.mame.net/

   - Header files for GTK+ version 2.10 (or higher).

       The GTK+ header files should be available from your GNU/Linux
       distribution as a "development" package. The exact package
       name varies by distribution, but it should be something
       similar to gtk2-devel or libgtk2.0-dev.

   - Header files for SQLite version 3.x.

       This should also be available from your distribution as a
       "development" package. The package is named sqlite-devel,
       libsqlite3-dev or similar.

   - history.dat (optional)

       This file, available from http://www.arcade-history.com,
       contains historical information as well as tips and tricks
       for many arcade games. GNOME Video Arcade can utilize this
       information in its Properties window.


Installation
------------

The INSTALL file has some generic but detailed installation
instructions that are applicable to most Free Software packages,
including GNOME Video Arcade. This section supplements the INSTALL
file with information specific to GNOME Video Arcade.

These instructions are written specifically for GNOME Video Arcade
version 0.4.2 and may change in forthcoming releases.

The standard installation procedure looks like this:

   $ cd /path/to/gnome-video-arcade-0.4.2
   $ ./configure
   $ make
   $ su -c "make install"
   (Prompted for root password)

   To start: Applications -> Games -> Video Arcade

The MAME program name must begin with "sdlmame" or "xmame".  If
the configure script cannot find the MAME program, you can tell
it where the MAME program is like this:

   $ MAME=/path/to/program/sdlmame ./configure

Currently, the only configure option specific to GNOME Video Arcade
is --with-history-file, for specifying the location of a history.dat
file as mentioned above. Usage looks something like this:

   $ ./configure --with-history-file=/usr/share/xmame/history.dat


Usage
-----

GNOME Video Arcade does not currently have a help document, however
it is designed to be simple and easy to use. Please feel free to
email me with any questions, bugs, or suggestions.
